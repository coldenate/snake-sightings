# 🐍 Snake Sightings and Pet Ownership

This project analyzes data on snake sightings and pet ownership, visualizing the results using various graphs and charts. The data is stored in a CSV file (`rs.csv`) and is read into a Pandas dataframe using Python. The following visualizations are generated:

-   A horizontal bar chart showing the number of snake sightings by region (`snake_sightings.png`)
-   A pie chart showing the breakdown of pet ownership (`pet_ownership.png`)
-   A stacked bar chart showing the number of snake sightings by region and whether or not the person was bitten (`snake_sightings_bitten.png`)
-   A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of snake sightings and the number of children in the household (`snake_sightings_children.png`)
-   A pie chart showing the breakdown of conservation responses (`conservation_responses.png`)
-   A bar chart showing the number of snake sightings by type of pet owned (`snake_sightings_pets.png`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python and the following packages installed:

-   pandas 🐼
-   matplotlib 📈
-   catppuccin 🎨

You can install these packages using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) by running `poetry install` in the project directory. Then run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment.

Once you have the dependencies installed and the environment is activated, you can run the project by running `python main.py` in the project directory. This will generate the visualizations and save them as PNG files in the project directory.

## 📊 Data

> Data began anonymous, and the regions were modified to be more general. The data was collected from a survey of 20 people. Networking was present, so there are close connections between some of the people surveyed. The data was collected in the United States, and the survey was conducted in English. The survey was conducted in 2023 - Apr 23-25. It was open to anyone.

The data used in this project is stored in `rs.csv` and contains the following columns:

-   Timestamp ⏰: the date and time of the sighting
-   Snakes 🐍: the number of snakes sighted
-   Venom 💉: the number of venomous snakes sighted
-   Region 🌎: the region where the sighting occurred
-   Children 👶: whether or not there were children in the household
-   Bitten 😱: whether or not the person was bitten by a snake
-   Response 🤔: the person's response to the sighting
-   Conservation 🌿: whether or not the person considers themselves a conservationist
-   Own 🐾: the type of pet owned
-   Children_Prox 👶🏻: whether or not the children were present during the sighting

## 📈 Results

The data shows that the majority of snake sightings occurred in Texas, with North Texas being the most common region. The pie chart of pet ownership shows that the most common type of pet owned was a mammal, followed by a bird. The stacked bar chart of snake sightings by region and bitten status shows that the majority of snake sightings did not result in a bite. The scatter plot of snake sightings and number of children in the household shows that there is not a strong correlation between the two variables. The pie chart of conservation responses shows that the most common response to encountering a snake was to do nothing, followed by calling for help. Finally, the bar chart of snake sightings by type of pet owned shows that people who owned rabbits had the highest number of snake sightings, followed by mammal owners.

## Notes

`This was a school assignment for a biology class. The data is real, and the use case of the code can be real, but it was made in like 30 minutes and just generally grew to be a nightmarish mess.`
